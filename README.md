I have resolved the fitting issue on your website. To fix it, please copy the code from "index2.html" and paste it into your "index.html."

Additionally, I have made enhancements to the website's theme and style. If you prefer, you can use this updated version instead. 
In that case, copy the code from "index.html" and paste it into your "index.html" in the website repository.
